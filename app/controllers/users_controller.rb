  # ADDING AUTHENTICATION
  # Keep in mind, currently you only prevent users from accessing other users' profiles when they are signed in. 
  # Someone who isn't signed in can just access all user Shows pages. 
  # Add before_filter :authenticate_user! (from the previous Exercise) above the load_and_authorize_resource line 
  # to make sure the user is signed in before trying to access the users_controller. 
  # Depending on the app you are building and the features you would like it to have, 
  # you might want to create an exception for the index action. This way, people can see all the users of your app 
  # without signing in. 
  # You create an exception like this: before_action :authenticate_user!, except: [:show, :index].  

  # GET /users
  # GET /users.json
  def index
    @users = User.all
  end

  # GET /users/1
  # GET /users/1.json

  # POST /users.json
